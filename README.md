# Kondo ðŸ§¹

Cleans unneeded directories and files from your system.

It will identify the disk space savings you would get from deleting temporary/unnecessary files from project directories, such as `target` from Cargo projects and `node_modules` from Node projects. Currently `kondo` doesn't actually delete any files.

Supports:

- Cargo projects
- Node projects
- Unity Projects
- SBT projects
- Haskell Stack projects
- Unity projects

## Roadmap

- Actually delete (with prompt)
- Handle Unity cache, editor cache

## Operation

Running `kondo` without a directory specified will run in the current directory.

```
$ kondo
```

Supplying an argument will tell `kondo` where to start.

```
$ kondo code/my_project
```

## Example Output

```
$ kondo ~
Scanning "C:/Users/Trent"
